#### Floyd's Tortoise & Hair Algorithm

* This algorithm will be efficient to find out whether a cycle is repeated or not.
* It works on the principle 
    * A slow pointer moves one step at a time
    * A fast pointer moves two steps at a time
    * At some point if slow value equals the fast value and it is not the end, then it is endless cycle
